Scenario: You have data organized into the following table. You¡¯d like to chart the tour with the total sales and sales person involved. What is the best way to create a chart that compares Mountain Bike Tour, Sales Person and Total Sales?





Solution: The best way to visually rearrange any summarized data is with a Pivot Chart. It is the capability of changing the arrangement simply by rotating row and column headings that gives Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts their names. Although you typically create a Pivot Table first, then a Pivot Chart, it is possible to create both simultaneously from a standard table by doing the following: 

1.     Select the range of data from your worksheet, Table/Range: A1:F13

2.     On the Insert tab, in the Tables group, click the PivotTable button down arrow and select PivotChart.  

3.     If desired, select to display the Pivot Chart on a New Worksheet.

4.     Click OK.

5.     In the PivotTable Field List, select Mountain Bike Tour, Sales Person and Total Sales.

6.     Close the PivotTable Field List and PivotChart Filter Pane by clicking the X in the upper right corner of each pane.

7.     Click-drag the left border of the Chart to resize it so that all the labels can all be read.

8.     Notice that the associated Pivot Table was also created on the left side of the chart.
